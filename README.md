This is a `python3` implementation of the neural network discussed in [Michael Nielsen's book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com)

The neural net is used as a classifier for handwritten digits .

I'll update this repository as i'm going through the book . wish me luck :smiley:

## Set Up

First you need pipenv to be installed globally, for that, run `pip install pipenv`

Then for installing the relevant packages for this repository, run `pipenv install` Which will create a virtual environment dedicated to this repository with all packages installed.

Now we have to spawn a shell inside that virtual environment to start working, to do so run `pipenv shell`

## Training the neural network

Simply run `py train.py`

Which will simulate training epochs and print progress to the console.

## Code Documentation

If you have read nielson's book then the code should be self explanatory, but If you didn't then i recommend you do, because there's a lot of information to explain in a README .

## Contributing

A pull request is welcome any time .
